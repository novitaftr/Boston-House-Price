# Regularized Regression to Predict Housing Prices in Boston

In this project, we aim to predict housing prices in Boston using regularized regression techniques, 
including Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, and Lasso Regression.

## Introduction
Predicting housing prices is a common and essential task in real estate and finance. 
Regularized regression techniques help improve the predictive performance of linear regression models 
by introducing penalties to prevent overfitting and improve generalization.

## Objective
The main objectives of this project are:
1. **Data Exploration**: Explore the Boston housing dataset to understand its structure, features, and distribution.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocess the dataset by handling missing values, scaling features, and splitting it into training and testing sets.
3. **Model Training**: Train three different regression models: Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, and Lasso Regression.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of each model using appropriate metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared, and others.

## Outlines
### 1. Data Exploration
   - Understand the structure and features of the Boston housing dataset.
   - Visualize distributions and correlations between variables.
### 2. Data Preprocessing
   - Handle missing values and duplicated data
   - Multicolinearity handling
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets
### 3. Model Training
   - Train a Linear Regression model to predict housing prices.
   - Train a Ridge Regression model with regularization.
   - Train a Lasso Regression model with regularization.
### 4. Model Evaluation
   - Evaluate the performance of each model using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared, and others.
   - Compare the performance of different models to identify the most effective one.

## Usage
1. **Dataset Setup**: Ensure that the Boston housing dataset is available in your working directory or specify the correct path to the dataset.
2. **Environment Setup**: Set up your Python environment and install the required dependencies.
3. **Running the Notebook**: Execute the provided Jupyter Notebook or Python script to run the analysis, train the models, and evaluate their performance.
